My Dotfiles
===========

This is a small collection of my dotfiles, feel free to look look and use something, if you wish to.

The repo contains a "install" script called link.sh, just execute this to link to the files from your home folder. But please(!) make a copy of your own dotfiles first, otherwise they might be overwritten or other bad stuff might happen.
